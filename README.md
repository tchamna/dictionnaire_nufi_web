# Nufi Dictionary App

This project is a React-based dictionary application that provides definitions and audio for Nufi language words. Users can click on words to hear pronunciation if an audio file exists, or double-click to see a definition if the word is defined in the dictionary.

## Features

- **Single Click**: Plays audio for words if an audio mapping exists.
- **Double Click**: Shows the definition if a word exists in the dictionary but doesn't have audio.
- **Styled Text**: Words with audio are underlined and blue, while words without audio but with a definition are black and not underlined.

## Install the dependencies:

npm install

## Run the application:

npm start
